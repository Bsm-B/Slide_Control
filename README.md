# Slide Control

Slide control is a tool that allows you to manage your slides in a presentation. It helps you to navigate through your presentation and control the flow of information that you are presenting. You can use it to move forward or backward through your slides, jump to specific slides, or even pause your presentation if you need to take a break or answer questions from your audience.
