# Bluetooth Slide Presentation Controller 

Slide Presentation Controller is a remote controller that allows you to manage your slides in a presentation. It helps you to navigate through your presentation and control the flow of information that you are presenting. You can use it to move forward or backward through your slides, jump to specific slides, or even pause your presentation if you need to take a break or answer questions from your audience.



# How is Work 

The "Bluetooth Slide Presentation Controller" project is a device that allows users to control their presentation slides wirelessly using an Arduino Nano and a Bluetooth module (HC-05). The project is divided into two parts - a client software and a remote controller.

The client software is built using VB.NET and is responsible for receiving commands from the remote controller and executing them. The remote controller is created using an Arduino Nano and a Bluetooth module and features two buttons - one for moving to the next slide and one for going back.

The principle of how this project works is quite simple. When the user clicks on either of the buttons on the remote controller, the remote sends information to the client software to move to the next slide or go back. The Bluetooth module allows for wireless communication between the two parts of the project, making it easy and convenient for users to control their presentation slides without the need to be close to their computer.
